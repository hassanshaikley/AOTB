  Interpolation / smoothness
  Implement Huntresss
  Make map look cool with random shit lmao (add clouds!)

GUI:
  >> Splash

Problems:
  Confusing ass lag, sometimes it is just jumpy
    ++Improve network code (Interpolation)
    ++Should try to talk to somebody about algorithm for animating where person is, I just average out the difference and move the next x spaces / x

Goals:
  Feel responsive
  Feel fast paced
  Movement + Gravity + Physics
  Map Design

IDES:
  Perhapas an FSM for movement states (charging, immobilized, free)
