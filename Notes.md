Now:
  Make file names consistent, place them in proper folders
  Fix bug where it animates after you stop moving
  When you first connect it displays you off center
  Make attacks work on tabbed out users 
  Render units in the proper location then play test
  
  NEXT:
    Implement Huntresss
    Make map look cool with random shit lmao (add clouds!)

GUI:
  >> Splash
    +Be able to set controls in the splash screen

Problems:
  Confusing ass lag, sometimes it is just jumpy
    ++Improve network code (Interpolation)
    ++Should try to talk to somebody about algorithm for animating where person is, I just average out the difference and move the next x spaces / x

Goals:
  Feel responsive
  Feel fast paced
  Movement + Gravity + Physics
  Map Design

IDES:
  Perhapas an FSM for movement states (charging, immobilized, free)
