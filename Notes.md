Now:
  Make attacks work on tabbed out users 
  Unclutter global namespace
  Swipe animation
  Sometimes own bomb hurts you sometimes it doesn't
  
  Let config report on cooldown, and turn that into what tooltip used

  NEXT:
    Implement Huntresss
    Make map look cool with random shit lmao (add clouds!)

GUI:
  >> Splash
    +Be able to set controls in the splash screen

Problems:
  Confusing ass lag, sometimes it is just jumpy
    ++Improve network code (Interpolation)
    ++Should try to talk to somebody about algorithm for animating where person is, I just average out the difference and move the next x spaces / x

Goals:
  Feel responsive
  Feel fast paced
  Movement + Gravity + Physics
  Map Design

IDES:
  Perhapas an FSM for movement states (charging, immobilized, free)

Hackers
  Don't ban hackers, put them in a server together

Javascript
  Use require.js for shared code between client and server

Takeaway:
  I have random numbers without knowing the importance when re-reading the code.
