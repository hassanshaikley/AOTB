/*  Prototype 
 * So Player.prototye.toString = function() {
 *  } is an easer way to give this function to all of one object
 * The way I do it now is kind of annoying... where it's in the return
 * armed with this, try to refactor
 * -  - - - - -
 * Singleton
 * var Singleton = {  property1: "swag",method1:function() {  return "yolo" ;}} 
 * Note, this is all public. If you want to do private then that's different
 * Refer to page 41 of Addy Osmanis books for that d :
 * Along hte lines of var singleton = function() {  private stuff, return { public methods}}
