#HI GUYS

This is code for a multiplayer game written in JS. 

I plan to implement MVC and apply better design patterns as well as write more tests in the near future! Then after more of the foundation has been layed / framework for the game has been built then I plan on creating more art and adding more to the game.

If you have any tips please comment! Especially with respect to design patterns or using the database.

This project is still in a really early stage and has a lot of bugs that I am aware! [As well as a lot that I am not, I am sure!]

##Demo

http://amara-staging.herokuapp.com 

##Running

    git clone https://hassanshaikley@bitbucket.org/hassanshaikley/amara-game.git && cd amara-game

Also recommend nodemon!

    npm install -g nodemon.

if you installed nodemon, then simply run:

    nodemon web.js

if not, then this will do the trick:

    node web.js

##Testing

Tests are written in Mocha

    npm install -g mocha.

Then simply run

    npm test
